    Gameplay Description
    1. Character Development
    Players can create a character by choosing from a range of classes such as Warrior, Mage, Archer, or any new classes added like Paladin or Rogue. Each class has unique abilities and stats, influencing their role in combat and interactions with the game world.
    
    Characters have a set of attributes, including Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Charisma, Wisdom, and Constitution. These attributes affect combat effectiveness, magical abilities, and social interactions. Players can allocate skill points to enhance these attributes as they level up.
    
    Skills such as Attack, Defense, Magic, Stealth, Alchemy, Crafting, and Persuasion offer deep customization. Each skill can be leveled up, improving the character’s abilities. For example, leveling up the Magic skill increases spell damage and reduces mana cost.
    
    2. Combat System
    Combat is dynamic, allowing players to choose from various actions, such as attacking with weapons, casting spells, or defending against incoming attacks. The combat system factors in the player’s and enemy's attributes, skills, and equipment.
    
    Enemies have varying difficulty levels, ranging from easy to legendary. Each enemy adjusts its stats based on its difficulty, making battles more challenging and rewarding as players progress.
    
    3. Exploration and Cities
    The game features five distinct cities: Eldoria, Stormwind, Ironforge, Rivendell, and Shadowfen. Each city offers unique quests, merchants, and environments. Exploration can lead to random events such as encounters with merchants, battles, treasure discoveries, or finding companions.
    
    4. Quests and Objectives
    Quests play a central role, offering players a variety of tasks, including defeating enemies, collecting items, or exploring new areas. Completing quests rewards players with experience, gold, and unique items. Quests can be tracked in the quest log, and players can complete or abandon them as they see fit.
    
    5. Guild System
    Players can join or create guilds, which provide additional benefits, including shared resources, guild quests, and the ability to level up the guild itself. Members can contribute resources to help upgrade the guild, unlocking new perks for all members.
    
    6. Inventory and Equipment
    The inventory system allows players to collect and equip various items, including weapons, armor, and accessories. Players can manage their inventory, equip items to enhance their combat abilities, and trade items with merchants.
    
    7. Companions
    Companions are NPCs that can join the player's party, each with specific roles like healer, tank, or DPS. They can assist in combat, heal the player, or provide other benefits during exploration. Companions level up alongside the player, becoming more effective as they gain experience.
    
    8. Faction and Reputation
    Players can join factions like the Brotherhood of Steel, Mages Guild, or Thieves Guild. Faction standing influences interactions with NPCs, access to exclusive quests, and special rewards. Reputation with different cities and factions can be gained or lost based on the player’s actions.
    
    9. Multiplayer Features
    The game includes online multiplayer functionality, allowing players to interact, trade, and complete quests together. Players can form parties to tackle more challenging content or compete in PvP combat. The server can handle multiple players, each with their own unique character, progressing through the game world.
    
    10. Rest and Recovery
    Players can rest to recover health, mana, and stamina. Resting is crucial, especially after intense battles or long exploration sessions. Resting also serves as a way to pass time, influencing day-night cycles and certain time-sensitive events.
    
    This enhanced version of the game provides a rich, immersive experience, with deep character customization, intricate combat mechanics, a vast world to explore, and robust multiplayer features. Players can dive into a detailed fantasy world, build powerful characters, form alliances, and engage in epic quests, all within a well-crafted, text-based RPG framework.
